# Hi, I'm Chang Ho Lee.

I'm a software engineer that's also crazy about games of all kinds (as long as they're digital!). As a tribute to one of my favorite genres of all time - 8 bit RPG - I decided to stylize my site after some of the tropes and cliches you would find in one. Please enjoy, and try to find all the hidden easter eggs!
